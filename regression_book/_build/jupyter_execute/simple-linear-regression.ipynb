One main purpose of regression is to predict $Y_i$ from of instances of $X_i$, and so it is common to refer to $Y_i$ as the response variable and $X_i$ as the predictor variable. The quantities $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are called the *intercept* and *slope*, respectively, and are assumed to be fixed and unknown. Together they are known as the model *coefficients* or *parameters*. It is these unknown parameters that we wish to estimate, so that we can describe the relationship between the $Y_i$ and $X_i$."
